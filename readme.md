My config files, **everything is work in progress**.

Vim user currently learning emacs.

Should all work in linux and partially in windows 10.

End goals: 
* a guix config to make it easily shared
* a nvim setup giving easy interaction with
  * R, 
  * Matlab (perhaps octave), 
  * lisp dialect (guile or e-lisp),
  * HTML/CSS
  * LaTeX, 
  * neatroff (perhaps groff), 
  * org (perhaps vim wiki)
* Effective window management with dwm perhaps also
  * a framebuffer/tty environment
  * an audio environment 
* FFmpeg and imagemagick scripts for basic video creation
