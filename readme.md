My config files, **everything is work in progress**.

Should all work in linux, emacs stuff is for windows 10.

End goals: 
* a guix config to make it easily shared
* a nvim setup giving easy interaction with
  * R, 
  * octave, 
  * guile,
  * HTML/CSS
  * LaTeX, 
  * neatroff (perhaps groff), 
  * org (perhaps vim wiki)
* Effective window management with dwm
* an audio environment (maybe) 
* FFmpeg and imagemagick scripts for basic video creation
